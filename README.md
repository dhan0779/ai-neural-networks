# Neural Networks and Clustering Algorithms

## Circle Point Neural Network
- Detects whether a point is inside or outside of a circle based on equation

## Logic Gates Neural Network
- Creates neural network and weights based on different logic gates (AND/OR)

## K Means Clustering
- From an image, creates another image that only uses user-given number of colors
